Online Food Ordering Behavior Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project explores online food ordering behavior by analyzing customer preferences, restaurant performance, and key factors influencing customer choices. By using a data-driven approach, we aim to uncover patterns in ordering habits, restaurant ratings, and operational factors such as delivery time and pricing. Insights gained from this analysis are valuable for restaurants and food delivery platforms aiming to optimize their strategies for maximizing customer satisfaction and profitability.

🎯 Objective
Identify factors that influence customer ordering behavior.
Analyze the impact of restaurant ratings on order volume.
Explore how delivery time, cost, and offers affect customer decisions.
Understand order frequency patterns and peak order times.
Gain insights into customer demographics and their preferences for food delivery services.
